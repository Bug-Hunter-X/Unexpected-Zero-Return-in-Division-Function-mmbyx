# Unexpected Zero Return in Division Function

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in JavaScript related to division by zero. The `foo` function attempts to handle zero values, but it contains a flaw that results in an incorrect return value when both input parameters are zero.

The bug is explained in detail in `bug.js`, while the corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling and input validation to prevent unexpected behavior in JavaScript functions.
